# SubPirate Codebase Bug Review

## CRITICAL ISSUES (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Security Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Hardcoded Service Role Key in Webhook Server**
  - Location: `/webhook-server.js` (lines 97-99)
  - Issue: A hardcoded service role key with unrestricted database access is included in the code
  - Impact: Complete database compromise as this key provides admin-level access to all data
  - Suggestion: Remove hardcoded key and use environment variables exclusively

- [ ] **Insecure JWT Impersonation in RLS Tester**
  - Location: `/src/lib/rls-tester.ts` (lines 43-50)
  - Issue: Creates JWT tokens that can impersonate any user without proper authorization checks
  - Impact: Allows complete identity theft of any user if exposed
  - Suggestion: Remove or secure this functionality with strong authorization

- [ ] **SQL Injection Vulnerability in Direct Database Access**
  - Location: `/webhook-server.js` (lines 427-462)
  - Issue: Query parameters are directly incorporated in SQL statements without proper parameterization
  - Impact: Potential SQL injection allowing unauthorized access
  - Suggestion: Use parameterized queries for all database operations

- [ ] **Missing Authentication on Critical API Endpoints**
  - Location: `/webhook-server.js` (lines 398-424)
  - Issue: `/api/campaigns/process` endpoint lacks authentication
  - Impact: Unauthorized campaign post processing
  - Suggestion: Add proper authentication middleware to all API routes

- [ ] **Insecure Credential Handling in RedditOAuthCallback**
  - Location: `/src/pages/RedditOAuthCallback.tsx` (lines 214-216)
  - Issue: Client and server secrets stored in reddit_accounts table and exposed in client-side code 
  - Impact: Exposed credentials could be used to access Reddit accounts
  - Suggestion: Move token exchange to a server-side endpoint and never expose secrets in client code

- [ ] **Stripe API Key Exposure in Client-Side Code**
  - Location: `/src/lib/stripe/client.ts` (lines 5-7)
  - Issue: The code attempts to access `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in client-side code
  - Impact: If the secret key is included in the client build, it would expose full access to the Stripe account
  - Suggestion: Move all Stripe key handling to server-side code only

- [ ] **Missing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
  - Location: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (entire file)
  - Issue: No CSRF tokens or protections implemented for authentication operations
  - Impact: Vulnerable to CSRF attacks that could perform actions on behalf of authenticated users
  - Suggestion: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations

- [ ] **Missing Content-Security-Policy Headers**
  - Location: `/webhook-server.js` (lines 54-56)
  - Issue: Helmet is used but no specific CSP configuration is provided
  - Impact: Potential for XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts
  - Suggestion: Configure CSP headers appropriately

- [ ] **Hardcoded API Keys**
  - Location: `/src/lib/openrouter.ts` (lines 5, 26)
  - Location: `/src/features/campaigns/services/reddit.ts` (line 379)
  - Issue: API keys exposed in client-side code

  - Suggestion: Move all API key handling to server-side endpoints

### Database Integrity Issues
- [ ] **Recursive RLS Policy Issues in Project Table**
  - Location: `/migrations/consolidated_rls_implementation.sql`
  - Issue: Project members policy has a circular reference, querying the same table within the policy conditions
  - Impact: Causes infinite recursion and performance degradation
  - Suggestion: Rewrite policy to avoid recursive references

- [ ] **Insufficient RLS Policy Testing**
  - Location: `/src/lib/rls-tester.ts`
  - Issue: Testing is incomplete for many critical tables
  - Impact: Security vulnerabilities may exist in untested areas
  - Suggestion: Implement comprehensive RLS policy tests for all tables

- [ ] **Race Condition in Stripe Webhook Processing**
  - Location: `/webhook-server.js` (lines 164-270)

- [ ] **Storage Bucket Policy Creation Issue**
  - Location: `/src/features/campaigns/lib/api.ts` (lines 264-285)
  - Issue: Uses `execute_sql` RPC which is dangerous and might have excessive permissions
  - Impact: Could create insecure storage policies that allow unauthorized access to media files
  - Suggestion: Use service_role key with proper permissioning for storage bucket policy management

- [ ] **No Sanitization of Content for Reddit Post Creation**
  - Location: `/src/features/campaigns/services/reddit.ts`
  - Issue: User-provided content is not properly sanitized before being submitted to the Reddit API
  - Impact: Potential for XSS attacks or injection of malicious content through the application to Reddit
